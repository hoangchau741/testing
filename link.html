        Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hoping I don't repeat history
Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday (ah)
Never need no (no), no one else, babe
'Cause I'll be
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for
Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true (you're too good to be true)
But I get tired of runnin'
Fuck it, now I'm runnin' with you, with you
Said, boy I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday (ah)
Never need no (no), no one else, babe
'Cause I'll be
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you
This some shit that I usually don't do (yeah)
But for you I kinda, kinda want to
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too (and I'm down too)
Yeah, I'm down too
Switchin' them positions for you
This some shit that I (yeah) usually don't do (don't do)
But for you I kinda, kinda want to
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom

Yeah
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah

    <h2>Willow</h2>

    <pre>I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
        Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
        And if it was an open-shut case
        I never would've known from that look on your face
        Lost in your current like a priceless wine
        The more that you say, the less I know
        Wherever you stray, I follow
        I'm begging for you to take my hand
        Wreck my plans, that's my man
        Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
        Head on the pillow, I can feel you sneaking in
        As if you were a mythical thing
        Lik e you were a trophy or a champion ring
        But there was one prize I'd cheat to win
        The more that you say, the less I know
        Wherever you stray, I follow
        I'm begging for you to take my hand
        Wreck my plans, that's my man
        You know that my train can take you home
        Anywhereâ€¦</pre>
